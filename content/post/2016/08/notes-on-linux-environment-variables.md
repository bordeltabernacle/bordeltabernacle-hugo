Environment variables are a pretty fundamental aspect of working with Linux, and
are often assumed knowledge in blog posts and tutorials. But they're also one of
those things that are so basic they can get overlooked, and I have to admit I've
been able to survive using Linux without really knowing how to use and
manipulate environment variables. So, this is me taking the time to understand
them better.
