Hi, I'm Rob Phoenix. I'm an accidental software engineer, with a Masters in
Computer Networking and a Bachelors in Fine Art. I mostly write Go and Python. I
heart Linux.  I'm learning C and Lua. I've spent time coding Elixir, Clojure and
JavaScript(obvs). Every so often I will configure routers, switches, servers and
VMs with Ansible or by hand. I find solutions to problems. I live in rural North
Wales, UK, with my wife and 2 kids, our 2 dogs, 1 pony & 1 sheep, read books,
chop wood, bake bread, and only sometimes have a beard.
