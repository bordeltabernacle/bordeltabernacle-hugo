My name is Rob Phoenix. I was born just before the 1980's. I used to be an
artist, working in retail/hospitality/care/youth work/education to support myself.
Then, a few years back I fell in love, moved to North Wales and started a family.
I made a *'life decision'*, decided not to be a teacher, and towards the end of
2014 I completed an MSc in Computer Networking and got my CCNA. This was an
interesting time in networking, still is, and talk of Network Automation and
Software-Defined was rife.  So I started to learn Python, because I was shit-scared
I wasn't going to get a job and wanted to arm myself with as many skills as possible.
Luckily, through perseverance, luck and kindness from others, before completing
my MSc I started working for a large UK VAR as an Alpha/Beta Testing Lab Engineer.
Very quickly, because of the little Python knowledge I had, I became the
*'Scripting Guy'*, something that unnerved me at first, but that I quickly embraced.
I am now a Systems Engineer with the same company, focusing on network automation,
writing code and building stuff.
